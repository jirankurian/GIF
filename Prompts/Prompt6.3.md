**Your Current Task: Task 6.3 - Exploratory Research: Meta-Cognition & Interface Self-Generation**

**Protocol Reminder:** Before you begin, you must execute your full **Cognitive Cycle**. Review the `/Rules` directory, the `/Reference/` for Phase 6, read all logs in the `.context/` (confirming the completion of the advanced `DU_Core_V2` and the `KnowledgeAugmenter`), and analyze the current project structure. This task will add a new layer of intelligence on top of the existing framework. After your analysis, formulate your micro-plan and present it for approval.

-----

### **Task Objective**

This task is divided into two distinct, exploratory sub-tasks. Your goal is to build prototypes that demonstrate the framework's potential for:

1.  **Meta-Cognition:** The ability of the GIF to reason about its own components and intelligently select the right "tools" (Encoders/Decoders) for a given job.
2.  **Self-Generation:** The ability of the framework to autonomously generate simple, new software modules from natural language instructions.

### **Part 1: Meta-Cognitive Routing**

#### **Domain & Technical Specifications**

  * **Domain Context:** A truly intelligent system should not require a human to manually select its tools for every task. It should have an awareness of its own capabilities. This concept, inspired by frameworks like `SymRAG` mentioned in your research, is a form of **meta-cognition** or "thinking about thinking." Our GIF will look at a piece of data, analyze its properties, and decide for itself, "This looks like a periodic time-series signal; I should use my Fourier-based encoder."
  * **Technical Approach:** We will upgrade the `GIF` orchestrator to include a `MetaController` that analyzes incoming data and dynamically selects the appropriate modules from a registered library.

#### **Implementation Plan for Meta-Cognitive Routing**

  * **Action 1: Create a Module Library.**

      * Create a new file: `gif_framework/module_library.py`.
      * Implement a `ModuleLibrary` class. This class will act as a registry. It will have a method `register_module(module_instance, metadata: dict)`.
      * The `metadata` dictionary is key. It will describe the module's capabilities, for example: `{'type': 'encoder', 'data_modality': 'timeseries', 'signal_type': 'periodic'}`.

  * **Action 2: Implement the `MetaController`.**

      * In `gif_framework/orchestrator.py`, create a `MetaController` class.
      * This class will have one primary method: `analyze_data(self, raw_data: Any) -> dict`.
      * This method will perform simple analysis to generate metadata about the input data. For example, if the data is a 1D array, it might calculate its power spectrum to see if it's periodic and return: `{'data_modality': 'timeseries', 'signal_type': 'periodic'}`.

  * **Action 3: Upgrade the `GIF` Orchestrator.**

      * Modify the `GIF` class `__init__` method to accept a `ModuleLibrary` instance.
      * Remove the old `attach_encoder` and `attach_decoder` methods.
      * Create a new method: `auto_configure_for_data(self, raw_data: Any)`. This method will:
        1.  Use the `MetaController` to analyze the `raw_data` and get its metadata.
        2.  Query the `ModuleLibrary` to find the registered encoder and decoder whose metadata best matches the data's metadata.
        3.  Set these as the active encoder and decoder for the current task.

### **Part 2: NL-to-Interface Self-Generation**

#### **Domain & Technical Specifications**

  * **Domain Context:** A long-term goal for AGI is self-sufficiencyâ€”the ability to create its own tools. As a proof-of-principle for this, we will demonstrate the framework's ability to generate a simple, new Python module (an interface) from a plain English command.
  * **Technical Approach:** We will use a **template-based code generation** approach. We will define a string template for a simple Python class and use a modern Large Language Model (LLM) as the "reasoning engine" to fill in the template's logic based on the user's natural language request.

#### **Implementation Plan for Self-Generation**

  * **Action 1: Create the Generation Script.**

      * Create a new script: `applications/self_generation/generate_interface.py`.

  * **Action 2: Define the Code Template.**

      * Inside the script, create a multi-line string that serves as a template for a new Decoder class. It will have placeholders for the class name and the core logic.
        ```python
        CODE_TEMPLATE = """
        from gif_framework.interfaces.base_interfaces import DecoderInterface, SpikeTrain, Action
        import torch

        class {CLASS_NAME}(DecoderInterface):
            def decode(self, spike_train: SpikeTrain) -> Action:
                # --- START OF GENERATED LOGIC ---
                {LOGIC_HERE}
                # --- END OF GENERATED LOGIC ---
        """
        ```

  * **Action 3: Implement the `InterfaceGenerator` Class.**

      * This class will orchestrate the generation process.
      * `generate_from_prompt(self, user_prompt: str)`:
        1.  **Formulate LLM Prompt:** It will take the `user_prompt` (e.g., "Create a decoder named 'HighActivityDecoder' that returns True if the total spike count is over 500, and False otherwise") and wrap it in a more detailed prompt for an LLM. This prompt will instruct the LLM to only generate the Python code for the *logic* that should go inside the `decode` method.
        2.  **Call LLM Engine:** This step will use an external LLM API (you can use me, `Augment Code AI`, or make a call to another service like OpenAI's API). You will send the formulated prompt to the LLM.
        3.  **Inject Code into Template:** It will take the Python code returned by the LLM and inject it into the `CODE_TEMPLATE`, replacing the `{CLASS_NAME}` and `{LOGIC_HERE}` placeholders.
        4.  **Save the New File:** It will save the completed code as a new Python file in the `applications/poc_medical/decoders/` directory.

-----

**Summary of your task:**

1.  **For Meta-Cognition:** Implement the `ModuleLibrary` and `MetaController` classes, and then upgrade the main `GIF` class to use them for auto-selecting the correct encoder/decoder for a given task.
2.  **For Self-Generation:** Implement the `InterfaceGenerator` script, which uses a code template and an LLM call to generate a new, simple decoder class from a natural language prompt.
3.  Ensure all new components are well-documented.

Now, following your protocol, please formulate your micro-plan for this task.

**Awaiting approval to proceed.**
