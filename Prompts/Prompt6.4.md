**Your Current Task: Task 6.4 - Documentation, Packaging, and Open-Source Release**

**Protocol Reminder:** Before you begin, you must execute your full **Cognitive Cycle**. Review the `/Rules` directory, the `/Reference/` for Phase 6, read all logs in the `.context/` to confirm the completion of all prior development tasks, and analyze the entire project codebase. You will find a feature-complete but likely under-documented project. This task will add the final layer of polish and professionalism required for a public release. After your analysis, formulate your micro-plan and present it for approval.

### **Task Objective**

Your goal is to transform our research codebase into a high-quality, professional open-source software package. This involves three critical activities:
1.  **Creating Comprehensive Documentation:** To ensure others can understand and use the framework.
2.  **Packaging the Code:** To make the framework easy to install and distribute.
3.  **Preparing the GitHub Repository:** To present the project to the world in a clear and professional manner.

### **Domain & Technical Specifications**

#### **1. The Importance of Documentation and Accessibility**

* **Domain Context:** Even the most brilliant software is useless if no one can understand how to use it. For your research to have a lasting impact and become a "landmark" contribution, other researchers and developers must be able to install, use, and extend your framework. Good documentation is not an afterthought; it is a core feature of high-impact scientific software.
* **Technical Approach:** We will use **Sphinx**, the de-facto standard for generating beautiful, comprehensive documentation for Python projects.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

This task is broken down into three sub-tasks: Documentation, Code Finalization, and Repository Preparation.

#### **Sub-Task A: Create Comprehensive Documentation**

* **Action:** You will set up and populate a `/docs/` directory in the project root.
* **Implementation Details:**
    1.  **Initialize Sphinx:** Set up a Sphinx project inside the `/docs/` directory. Configure it to use a modern theme like `furo` or `book`.
    2.  **Auto-generate API Docs:** Configure Sphinx's `autodoc` extension to scan our entire `gif_framework` package and automatically generate detailed API documentation from the docstrings we have already written for all public classes and methods.
    3.  **Write User Guides:** You will write the following crucial documentation pages in reStructuredText (`.rst`) format:
        * **`index.rst`:** The main landing page for the documentation.
        * **`installation.rst`:** Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install the framework using `uv pip`.
        * **`quick_start.rst`:** A simple tutorial that walks a new user through running a pre-packaged example (like the exoplanet POC) to verify their installation.
        * **`architecture.rst`:** A high-level explanation of the GIF and DU philosophy, including diagrams of the architecture.
        * **`tutorial_custom_module.rst`:** This is the most important tutorial. It will provide a step-by-step guide on how a developer can create their *own* custom `Encoder` and `Decoder` by inheriting from our interfaces and then "plugging" them into the `GIF` orchestrator.

#### **Sub-Task B: Code Finalization and Packaging**

* **Action:** You will perform a final quality pass on the entire codebase and configure it for packaging.
* **Implementation Details:**
    1.  **Code Styling and Linting:** Run `ruff format .` and `ruff check --fix .` on the entire project to ensure 100% consistent code style and fix any remaining linting issues.
    2.  **Docstring Review:** Perform a final review of all public classes and methods in the `gif_framework` package to ensure their docstrings are clear, complete, and follow a consistent style (e.g., Google Style).
    3.  **Finalize `pyproject.toml`:** Update the configuration file to prepare it for public distribution. This includes:
        * Adding descriptive metadata: `description`, `authors`, `license`.
        * Adding "classifiers" to help others find the package on PyPI (the Python Package Index).
        * Adding the URL to the public GitHub repository.

#### **Sub-Task C: Prepare the Public GitHub Repository**

* **Action:** You will create the key markdown files that define the project's public-facing presentation.
* **Implementation Details:**
    1.  **Create `LICENSE` file:** Add a file named `LICENSE` to the root directory containing the text of a permissive open-source license, such as **MIT** or **Apache 2.0**.
    2.  **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** Add a file that provides guidelines for other developers who might want to contribute to the project (e.g., how to report bugs, how to submit code changes via pull requests).
    3.  **Write a Professional `README.md`:** This is the front door to your project. You will create a new, high-quality `README.md` file. It must include the following sections:
        * A project title and a short, powerful summary of the GIF/DU vision.
        * Badges (e.g., for the license, PyPI version, build status).
        * **Key Features:** A bulleted list highlighting the framework's main capabilities (Modularity, RTL, System Potentiation, etc.).
        * **Installation:** A simple code block showing the `uv pip install gif_framework` command.
        * **Quick Start:** A short, self-contained Python code example demonstrating how to use the framework.
        * **Link to Full Documentation:** A prominent link to the Sphinx documentation we created in Sub-Task A.
        * **How to Contribute:** A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
        * **Citation Information:** A section explaining how other researchers should cite your work if they use your framework.

**Summary of your task:**

1.  Set up a Sphinx documentation project and populate it with both auto-generated API docs and crucial user tutorials.
2.  Perform a final code cleanup and configure the `pyproject.toml` for public distribution.
3.  Write the essential repository files: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a comprehensive, professional `README.md`.

Now, following your protocol, please formulate your micro-plan for this task.

**Awaiting approval to proceed.**
