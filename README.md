# General Intelligence Framework (GIF)

A landmark open-source artificial general intelligence framework built on spiking neural networks and real-time learning mechanisms.

## Overview

The General Intelligence Framework (GIF) is a modular, extensible platform designed to serve as a "body" for the revolutionary **Deep Understanding (DU) Core** - a continuously learning cognitive "brain." Unlike monolithic AI models, GIF provides a plug-and-play architecture that allows researchers to attach novel sensors (Encoders) and actuators (Decoders) to a central intelligence that learns in real-time.

## Key Features

### 🧠 **Continuous Real-Time Learning (RTL)**
- Learn from constant data streams without offline retraining
- Biologically plausible plasticity mechanisms (STDP, three-factor rules)
- Online synaptic weight updates during inference

### 🔄 **Cross-Domain Generalization**
- Transfer understanding between completely different domains
- Proven ability to apply knowledge from astrophysics to medical diagnostics
- Domain-agnostic learning representations

### 📈 **System Potentiation**
- Emergent property where the framework becomes more efficient with diverse experiences
- Accelerated learning on new tasks after exposure to different domains
- Empirically validated performance improvements

### 🔌 **Plug-and-Play Architecture**
- Modular encoder/decoder interfaces
- Easy integration of new input/output modalities
- Dependency injection for maximum flexibility

### ⚡ **Neuromorphic Computing Ready**
- Event-driven computation model
- Energy-efficient spiking neural network implementation
- Hardware simulation for neuromorphic chips (Intel Loihi 2)
