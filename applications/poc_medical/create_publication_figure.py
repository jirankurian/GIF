System Potentiation in Medical Diagnostics: Comprehensive Analysis.

(A) Learning efficiency comparison showing accuracy vs training samples for naive GIF-DU 
(blue) and pre-exposed GIF-DU (purple) models. The pre-exposed model reaches 90% accuracy 
230 samples faster despite identical starting weights due to weight-reset protocol.

(B) Performance metrics comparison across key learning efficiency measures, demonstrating 
consistent improvements in the pre-exposed model.

(C) Statistical significance testing results showing p-values for each metric with 
significance threshold (α = 0.05). All 4 independent tests reach statistical significance.

(D) Advanced analysis summary including few-shot learning performance across 1/5/10-shot 
scenarios, knowledge retention analysis, and representational similarity analysis (RSA) 
improvements.

(E) Clinical implications highlighting enhanced diagnostic capabilities and energy efficiency.

(F) Scientific conclusion summarizing the evidence for system potentiation hypothesis with 
key quantitative findings and impact assessment.

This figure provides comprehensive visual evidence that diverse prior experience fundamentally 
improves learning mechanisms in artificial neural networks, supporting the system potentiation 
hypothesis with multiple independent lines of evidence.
