Self-Generation Module - Autonomous Code Generation
=================================================

This module implements the self-generation capability of the GIF framework,
enabling autonomous creation of new interface modules from natural language
descriptions. This represents a significant step toward AGI by demonstrating
the system's ability to create its own tools.

The self-generation system uses template-based code generation combined with
Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning to translate natural language requirements
into functional Python code that integrates seamlessly with the GIF framework.

Key Features:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert plain English to code requirements
- **Template-Based Generation**: Structured code generation with safety guarantees
- **Interface Compliance**: Generated code automatically implements required interfaces
- **Validation Pipeline**: Syntax checking and functionality validation
- **Integration Ready**: Generated modules work seamlessly with GIF orchestrator

Technical Innovation:
The system demonstrates autonomous programming capabilities by:
1. Parsing natural language requirements
2. Formulating appropriate LLM prompts
3. Generating Python code logic
4. Injecting code into validated templates
5. Creating functional interface modules

This capability represents a proof-of-concept for self-modifying AI systems
and autonomous software development.
