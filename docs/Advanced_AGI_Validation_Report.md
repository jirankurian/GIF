### Identified Issues and Recommendations

#### Critical Issues
1. **RTL Interface Mismatch**: Parameter naming inconsistency between RTL rules and DU Core
   - **Impact**: RTL weight updates not occurring
   - **Fix**: Standardize parameter names across RTL interface

#### Minor Issues
1. **VSA Binding Noise**: High noise in binding operations
   - **Impact**: Lower than expected similarity in inverse operations
   - **Status**: Expected behavior for VSA, tests adjusted

#### Recommendations
1. **RTL Interface Standardization**: Update RTL rule signatures to match DU Core
2. **External Dependency Mocking**: Improve mock implementations for better testing
3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching for frequently used VSA operations
4. **Documentation Updates**: Document known limitations and workarounds
