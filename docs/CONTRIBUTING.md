# Contributing to the General Intelligence Framework (GIF)

We welcome contributions from the research community! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the GIF project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gif.git
   cd gif
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv pip install -e ".[dev,snn,data]"
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install -e ".[dev,snn,data]"
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ruff check .
   ```

## Code Quality Standards

We maintain high code quality standards using modern Python tooling:

### Linting and Formatting
- **Ruff**: Used for both linting and formatting
- Run `ruff check .` to check for issues
- Run `ruff format .` to auto-format code
- Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`

### Testing
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features

### Type Hints
- Use type hints for all public APIs
- Run `mypy` for type checking
- Follow PEP 484 conventions
