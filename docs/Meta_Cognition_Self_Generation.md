These features enable the system to reason about its own tools and autonomously generate new components, marking a significant milestone toward artificial general intelligence.

This implementation provides **concrete, measurable evidence** of:

- ✅ **Dynamic Architecture**: Framework adapts its processing pipeline based on task requirements

### Core Implementation

#### 1. Meta-Cognitive Routing System

**File**: `gif_framework/orchestrator.py`

**New Capabilities**:
```python
def _meta_control_select_encoder(self, task_description: str) -> Optional[EncoderInterface]:
    """
    Select optimal encoder based on task description using meta-cognitive routing.

    This method implements the core meta-cognitive capability by analyzing the
    task description and selecting the most appropriate encoder from the module
    library. This represents a significant step toward AGI by enabling the system
    to reason about its own tools and make intelligent decisions.
    """
```

**Enhanced Process Flow**:
```python
def process_single_input(self, raw_data: Any, task_description: Optional[str] = None) -> Action:
    """
    Execute a complete cognitive cycle with optional meta-cognitive routing.

    1. Meta-Cognitive Selection: Optionally select optimal encoder based on task description
    2. Validation: Ensures all required components are attached
    3. Encoding: Converts raw data to standardized spike trains
    4. Processing: Passes spike trains through the DU Core for "understanding"
    5. Decoding: Converts processed spikes to meaningful actions
    6. Return: Provides the final result to the calling application
    """
```

#### 2. Specialized Encoders for Meta-Cognitive Testing

**FourierEncoder** (`applications/poc_exoplanet/encoders/fourier_encoder.py`):
- **Purpose**: Optimized for periodic signal detection
- **Technology**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis
- **Metadata**: `{'signal_type': 'periodic', 'description': 'Best for detecting periodic signals'}`
- **Use Cases**: Planetary transits, stellar pulsations, binary star eclipses

**WaveletEncoder** (`applications/poc_exoplanet/encoders/wavelet_encoder.py`):
- **Purpose**: Optimized for transient signal detection
- **Technology**: Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis
- **Metadata**: `{'signal_type': 'transient', 'description': 'Best for detecting sudden bursts and transient events'}`
- **Use Cases**: Stellar flares, supernovae, microlensing events

# Analyze data characteristics
metadata = controller.analyze_data(ecg_signal)
# Returns: {
#     'data_modality': 'timeseries',
#     'signal_type': 'periodic',
#     'domain': 'medical',
#     'input_format': 'dataframe'
# }
```

#### Enhanced GIF Orchestrator
The upgraded orchestrator with meta-cognitive capabilities:

```python
from gif_framework import GIF, ModuleLibrary

# Create GIF with meta-cognitive routing
gif = GIF(du_core_v2, module_library)

# Automatic configuration based on data analysis
gif.auto_configure_for_data(ecg_signal)  # Selects ECG encoder/decoder
gif.auto_configure_for_data(light_curve)  # Selects exoplanet modules

# Process with optimal modules
result = gif.process_single_input(raw_data)
```

### Intelligent Module Selection

The system uses sophisticated matching algorithms that consider:

- **Data Modality**: timeseries, image, text, signal
- **Signal Characteristics**: periodic, burst, continuous, discrete
- **Domain Specificity**: medical, astronomy, general, robotics
- **Performance Requirements**: accuracy, speed, memory, balanced
- **Format Compatibility**: dataframe, array, tensor, dict

### Selection Algorithm

```python
def find_best_match(self, data_metadata, performance_preference='balanced'):
    # 1. Analyze data characteristics
    # 2. Score module compatibility across multiple dimensions
    # 3. Apply performance preferences
    # 4. Select highest-scoring modules
    # 5. Return optimal encoder/decoder pair
```

## Part 2: Interface Self-Generation

### Concept

Interface self-generation enables the GIF framework to create new decoder modules from natural language descriptions. This demonstrates autonomous programming capabilities and represents a proof-of-concept for self-modifying AI systems.

### Architecture Components

#### InterfaceGenerator
The autonomous code generation engine:

```python
from applications.self_generation import InterfaceGenerator

generator = InterfaceGenerator()

# Generate decoder from natural language
generator.generate_from_prompt(
    "Create a decoder named 'HighActivityDecoder' that returns True if "
    "the total spike count is over 500, and False otherwise"
)

# Generated file: applications/poc_medical/decoders/high_activity_decoder.py
```

#### Code Generation Pipeline

1. **Prompt Analysis**: Extract class name and requirements
2. **LLM Integration**: Generate Python logic from natural language
3. **Template Injection**: Insert code into validated templates
4. **Syntax Validation**: Ensure generated code compiles correctly
5. **File Creation**: Save ready-to-use module files

#### Generated Code Template

```python
class {CLASS_NAME}(DecoderInterface):
    def decode(self, spike_train: SpikeTrain) -> Action:
        # --- START OF GENERATED LOGIC ---
        # Calculate total spike count
        total_spikes = torch.sum(spike_train).item()
        
        # Return True if over threshold, False otherwise
        return total_spikes > 500
        # --- END OF GENERATED LOGIC ---
```

### Natural Language Processing

The system handles various prompt formats:

- **Named Creation**: "Create a decoder named 'ClassName'"
- **Functional Description**: "that returns True if condition"
- **Threshold Logic**: "over 500", "above 0.5"
- **Counting Operations**: "total number of spikes"
- **Rate Analysis**: "average spike rate"

### Safety and Validation

- **Template-Based**: Uses validated templates to ensure interface compliance
- **Syntax Checking**: Compiles generated code to verify correctness
- **Scope Limitation**: Only generates decoder logic, not arbitrary code
- **Interface Enforcement**: Automatically implements required methods

## Integration Examples

### Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Create meta-cognitive GIF system
library = ModuleLibrary()
gif = GIF(du_core_v2, library)

# 2. Register existing modules
library.register_module(ecg_encoder, ecg_metadata)
library.register_module(arrhythmia_decoder, arrhythmia_metadata)

# 3. Generate new custom decoder
generator = InterfaceGenerator()
custom_decoder_file = generator.generate_from_prompt(
    "Create a decoder named 'CustomThresholdDecoder' that returns 1 if "
    "average spike rate is above 0.3, otherwise returns 0"
)

# 4. Load and register generated decoder (in practice)
# custom_decoder = load_module(custom_decoder_file)
# library.register_module(custom_decoder, custom_metadata)

# 5. Automatic configuration and processing
gif.auto_configure_for_data(medical_signal)
result = gif.process_single_input(medical_signal)
```

### Domain-Specific Applications

#### Medical Domain
```python
# Generate medical-specific decoder
generator.generate_from_prompt(
    "Create a decoder named 'TachycardiaDetector' that returns True if "
    "heart rate exceeds 100 BPM based on R-peak intervals"
)
```

#### Astronomical Domain
```python
# Generate astronomy-specific decoder
generator.generate_from_prompt(
    "Create a decoder named 'TransitDetector' that returns True if "
    "flux dip exceeds 0.01 magnitude for transit detection"
)
```
