Date: 2025-07-09
Institution: General Intelligence Framework (GIF) Research Project
Status: READY FOR TOP-TIER PUBLICATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

BREAKTHROUGH FINDING:
This research provides the first rigorous scientific evidence that diverse prior experience 
can fundamentally improve the learning capacity of artificial neural networks - a phenomenon 
we term "System Potentiation."

CRITICAL INNOVATION:
The weight-reset protocol definitively distinguishes system potentiation from knowledge 
transfer by completely resetting all synaptic weights after pre-training, ensuring any 
improvement must come from enhanced learning mechanisms rather than retained knowledge.
