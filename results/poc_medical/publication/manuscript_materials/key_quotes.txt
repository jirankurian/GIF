ABSTRACT/INTRODUCTION:
"We demonstrate the first rigorous evidence for system potentiation in artificial neural networks,
where diverse prior experience improves fundamental learning mechanisms rather than just providing
transferable knowledge."

RESULTS:
"The pre-exposed model reached 90% accuracy 230 samples faster than the naive model
(27.1% improvement), despite having identical starting weights
due to the weight-reset protocol."

STATISTICAL EVIDENCE:
"Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements across 4 out of
4 independent measures (all p < 0.05), providing strong evidence against
the null hypothesis of no difference."

CONCLUSION:
"These findings provide the first rigorous demonstration that diverse prior experience can
fundamentally improve the learning capacity of artificial neural networks, with profound
implications for AGI development and continual learning research."
