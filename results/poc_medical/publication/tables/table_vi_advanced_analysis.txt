• Neural organization improvement: +34.0% better structure
• Representational quality: +0.156 separation improvement
• Overall evidence: 4/4 independent measures support potentiation

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
• Enhanced diagnostic accuracy for rare arrhythmia types
• Faster adaptation to new cardiac conditions
• Maintained expertise across multiple diagnostic domains
• Improved neural organization for medical decision-making
• Evidence for AGI-relevant learning mechanisms in medical AI

CONCLUSION: Advanced analysis provides additional evidence for system potentiation
across multiple dimensions: few-shot learning, knowledge retention, and neural
organization quality.
