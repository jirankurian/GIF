Neuromorphic Hardware Simulator
===============================

Software simulation layer that mimics the key operational characteristics of neuromorphic
hardware (e.g., Intel Loihi 2) for the General Intelligence Framework. This simulator
enables testing of Spiking Neural Networks under realistic hardware constraints without
requiring physical neuromorphic chips.

Key Features:
============

**Event-Driven Computation**: Unlike traditional neural networks that process data in
dense batches, neuromorphic hardware operates in an event-driven manner. Computation
only occurs when and where spikes (events) happen, leading to sparse, efficient processing.
This simulator enforces this paradigm by processing data one time-step at a time and
only performing computations for active neurons.

**Energy Efficiency Modeling**: The simulator estimates energy consumption based on
synaptic operations (SynOps) and spike counts, using realistic energy figures from
published neuromorphic hardware specifications. This enables quantitative analysis
of the energy benefits claimed for spiking neural networks.

**Biological Plausibility**: The event-driven nature mirrors how biological neural
networks operate, where neurons consume minimal energy until they receive or generate
spikes. This makes the simulation more representative of both biological and
neuromorphic hardware behavior.

Technical Implementation:
========================

The simulator operates by:
1. **Temporal Processing**: Processing input spike trains one time-step at a time
2. **Activity Monitoring**: Counting spikes and synaptic operations at each step
3. **Energy Calculation**: Estimating total energy consumption based on activity
4. **State Management**: Properly initializing and managing neuron membrane potentials

Energy Model:
============

The energy estimation is based on the fundamental unit of computation in neuromorphic
hardware: the Synaptic Operation (SynOp). A SynOp occurs every time a spike is
transmitted across a synapse, causing a change in the downstream neuron's membrane
potential.

Energy per SynOp: 2.5e-11 Joules (based on Intel Loihi 2 specifications)
Total Energy = Total SynOps Ã— Energy per SynOp

This model provides a realistic estimate of the energy advantages of sparse,
event-driven computation compared to dense matrix operations on traditional hardware.

Integration with GIF Framework:
==============================

The simulator is designed to work seamlessly with the GIF framework components:
- **DU Core**: Processes spike trains through the SNN architecture
- **Training Infrastructure**: Can be integrated with Continual_Trainer for experiments
- **Analysis Tools**: Provides detailed statistics for performance evaluation

Example Usage:
=============

    from gif_framework.core.du_core import DU_Core_V1
    from simulators.neuromorphic_sim import NeuromorphicSimulator
    import torch

    # Create SNN model
    du_core = DU_Core_V1(
        input_size=100,
        hidden_sizes=[64, 32],
        output_size=10
    )

    # Create neuromorphic simulator
    simulator = NeuromorphicSimulator(
        snn_model=du_core,
        energy_per_synop=2.5e-11  # Joules per synaptic operation
    )

    # Generate input spike train
    input_spikes = torch.rand(50, 1, 100)  # 50 time steps, batch size 1, 100 features

    # Run event-driven simulation
    output_spikes, stats = simulator.run(input_spikes)

    print(f"Total spikes: {stats['total_spikes']}")
    print(f"Total SynOps: {stats['total_synops']}")
    print(f"Estimated energy: {stats['estimated_energy_joules']:.2e} Joules")

This simulator enables rigorous evaluation of neuromorphic computing claims and provides
the foundation for realistic hardware-constrained experiments in the GIF framework.

class NeuromorphicSimulator:
    """
    Software simulator for neuromorphic hardware behavior.

    This class provides a software-based simulation environment that mimics the key
    operational characteristics of neuromorphic hardware, specifically event-driven
    computation and energy efficiency modeling. It enables testing of Spiking Neural
    Networks under realistic hardware constraints without requiring physical chips.

    The simulator enforces the fundamental principles of neuromorphic computing:
    1. **Event-Driven Processing**: Computation only occurs when spikes are present
    2. **Sparse Activity**: Only active neurons and synapses consume energy
    3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Processing happens one time-step at a time
    4. **Energy Awareness**: Tracks and estimates energy consumption based on activity

    Key Capabilities:
    ================

    **Event-Driven Execution**: Unlike traditional neural networks that process entire
    batches simultaneously, this simulator processes spike trains temporally, one
    time-step at a time. This mirrors how neuromorphic hardware operates and enforces
    the sparse, event-driven computation paradigm.

    **Energy Modeling**: The simulator tracks synaptic operations (SynOps) and spike
    counts to estimate energy consumption. This provides quantitative evidence for
    the energy efficiency claims of neuromorphic computing.

    **Hardware Realism**: By constraining computation to occur only when and where
    spikes are present, the simulator provides a more realistic testing environment
    for algorithms intended for neuromorphic hardware deployment.
